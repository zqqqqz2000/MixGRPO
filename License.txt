Note that we may also make available certain elements of what is included in the definition of “FLUX.1 [dev] Model” under a separate license, such as the inference code, and nothing in this License will be deemed to restrict or limit any other licenses granted by us in such elements.

If you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant to us that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to this License.
